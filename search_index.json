Things to consider when adding subdatasets / git submodules Good news: Travis CI clones Git submodules by default When using subdatasets aka. git submodules you should add options(bookdown.render.file_scope = FALSE); to your Rscript command, e.g., use: Rscript -e &quot;options(bookdown.render.file_scope = FALSE); bookdown::render_book(&#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;)&quot; Also, although this is vague advice, don’t add too many nested subdatasets (certainly not the same dataset) do avoid creating a long recursion down into the rabbit hole of submodules.

According to this Travis CI documentation … Travis CI clones Git submodules by default Importantly, the subdataset needs to be added using https and not ssh, i.e., I used: datalad clone --dataset . https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/bookdown-playground-subdataset.git subdataset Edit Actually, in this I create the subdataset locally first using datalad create -d . -c text2git subdataset and then added the GitHub remote origin afterwards using datalad siblings add -s origin --url https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/bookdown-playground-subdataset.git.
