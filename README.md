# Bookdown Playground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lnnrtwttkhn/bookdown-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lnnrtwttkhn/bookdown-playground)

## About

In this repo I experiment with [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/), [R Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).

The goal is to automatically deploy an R Bookdown page on GitHub pages via Travis CI.

The repo website should be available here: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/bookdown-playground/

The repo is a DataLad dataset (initialized with `-c text2git`) which is not really crucial because most relevant files are under `git` and not `git-annex` control.
However, if I later want to work with files under `git-annex` control this aspect might gain more relevance.
